#how luigi works

class Child():
  def run():
    print(1234)

class Parent():
  def run():
    yield Child()

#process about how luigi handles the above example:
1.parent will yield child as task
2.child task call child.complete() to see if it has been run or not, if not, run the task
2.parent keep calling child.complete() to see if it has been completed or not
