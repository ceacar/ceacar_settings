# 1 byte is 8 bits;
a byte could use decimal(base) of hexadecimal(16 base)

hexadecimal:  bytes 0xFF means 255 in decimal 

# difference of utf-8 utf-16 utf-32:
utf-8 uses one byte to represent a characters, lets say 41 which is one byte, utf-8 translates to A

# bytes representation
# this is wrong
\x is used for literal numbers. "0x" is used inside strings to represent a character
0x61 is 'a'
\x01 is 1
# \x41 is hex of 65
int.from_bytes(b'\x41', byteorder='big')
